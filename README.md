# Hi there!

I am an evolutionary biologist, who uses computers and mathematics to explore the evolution of complex biological systems. I am studying how evolution and second-order selection shape genotypes, phenotypes and populations in changing environments, with their share of surprising and counter-intuitive effects.

Check out my Github repositories to learn more about my ongoing modeling projects.

  &laquo; <em>Simulations are experimental systems. Their complexity can make them closer cousins in complexity to nature itself than to simple analytic models, but with a powerful advantage over the real world: the modeler has complete control of the system</em> &raquo; (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534704002162?casa_token=rjD7cTRbub4AAAAA:RzBJH8Iwlg-9ZYGpSSQUwJ3_D_BwEbPGyfakBe60kY2ADJhmFN4c7XvF1Yc5jOqioPLrd1IStVg">Peck, 2004</a>).
