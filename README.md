# Hi there!

<p align="justify">
I am an evolutionary systems biologist, who uses computers and mathematics to explore the evolution of complex biological systems. I am studying how evolution shape genotypes, phenotypes and populations in changing environments, with their share of surprising and counter-intuitive effects.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Depending on their complexity, I usually consider simulation models as experimental systems (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2004.07.019" target="_blank">Peck, 2004</a>) &mdash; I conduct <em>in silico</em> experiments in a computer as one would do in the real world (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrmicro2750" target="_blank">Hindr√© et al., 2012</a>).

  &laquo; <em>Simulations are experimental systems. Their complexity can make them closer cousins in complexity to nature itself than to simple analytic models, but with a powerful advantage over the real world: the modeler has complete control of the system.</em> &raquo; (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534704002162?casa_token=rjD7cTRbub4AAAAA:RzBJH8Iwlg-9ZYGpSSQUwJ3_D_BwEbPGyfakBe60kY2ADJhmFN4c7XvF1Yc5jOqioPLrd1IStVg">Peck, 2004</a>).
