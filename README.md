# Hi there!

I am an evolutionary biologist, who uses computers and mathematics to explore the evolution of complex biological systems. I am studying how evolution and second-order selection shape genotypes, phenotypes and populations in changing environments, with their share of surprising and counter-intuitive effects.

Check out my Github repositories to learn more about my ongoing modeling projects.
